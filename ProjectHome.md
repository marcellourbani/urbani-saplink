This is a repository of ABAP source code.

Actually it only contains a data browser similar to SE16 both with a standard report and a webdynpro interface (with two slightly different implementations).

**WARNING**:Due to a limitation in SAPLINK, the message texts are not included in the sources, and this can lead to short dumps in the webdynpro application.The last revision of the software includes a readme file with instructions on how to fix it.
